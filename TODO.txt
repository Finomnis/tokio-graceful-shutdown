Done:

- Name
- Error handling

- SubsystemBuilder (or PreparedSubsystem, or something similar)!
    - Allows creating subsystems:
        - from FnOnce (non-restartable)
        - from Fn (restartable)
        - from `trait Subsystem`
        - from `trait RestartableSubsystem`
    - maybe gets passed directly into `start`

- Solution to the entire "restartable subsystems" problem:
    - Make single subsystems awaitable! (Through the object returned from `start`)
    - Restart is then trivial to implement.
        - Make subsystem "Shutdown on Error/Panic"
        - Start/await it in a loop in the parent subsystem

- Error generic
